## FAQ
### What is a boilerplate ?
A boilerplate is a project with generic, maintainable and reusable code, files or content that is intended to be used as a starting point for creating new projects blazing fast without wasting time in setting up the basics each time.
### Why Redux-Saga ?
Redux Saga is a middleware library that allows a Redux store to interact with resources outside of itself in an asynchronous way, including making of HTTP requests to external services, accessing the browser storage, or executing any I/O operations. These operations are known as side effects. Redux-Saga helps us to organize and manage these side effects in easier way.
